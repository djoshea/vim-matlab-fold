" Vim folding file for Matlab .m files
" Language: Matlab  
" Author: Dan O'Shea <dan at djoshea.com>

"
" This plugin uses the indentation of your matlab code to know where to
" indent. Therefore, your function code must be indented with respect to the
" function keyword line which precedes it in order to be foldable. Also, this
" method doesn't deal with empty blocks correctly (e.g. a function with no
" body), since it doesn't know that there would be further indented code
" within.
"
" The code looks for end keywords to know where to end folds. Line
" continuations ... and comments are handled gracefully. Editor cells
" (beginning with %%) are also foldable even though the contents need 
" not be indented.
"
" This folding works best when the Matlab syntax and indent plugins authored
" by Fabrice Guy are also installed, which can be downloaded here:
"
"     http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2407
"
" Install:
"   - Place this file in ~/.vim/ftplugin/ or
"       ~/.vim/bundle/vim-matlab-fold/ftplugin/ if you're using Pathogen
"
"   - Make sure you have the following lines in your .vimrc
"       filetype plugin on 
"       filetype indent on

    " considered indented by the maximum of their surrounding lines indents.
    "
    " The optional second argument forces the recursive calculation of line
    " indents to proceed in a specific direction, which is only used
    " internally to handle blank lines and line continuations (...). If the
    " second argument is specified as 1, the recursion will precede
    " forward; if specified as -1 it preceeds backwards in the file, else it
    " proceeds in both directions for blank lines, taking the maximum in
    " either direction.
